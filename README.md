## How does this work?

It gets the user to completed their tasks before a certain time by showing them a clock by which they need to get their stuff completed, if they manage to do it they are rewarded with points.

## Why the leaderboard?

The leaderboard has been implemented to incentivize the users to complete more tasks and be competitive about it.
